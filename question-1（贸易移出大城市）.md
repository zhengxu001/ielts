&gt;&gt;&gt; In some countries, governments are encouraging industries and businesses to move out of large cities and into regional areas. Do you think the advantages of this development outweigh its disadvantages?\(080809\)



Increasing problems in big cities has led to the trend for many governments to encourage industries and businesses to move to regional areas. Although some people are worried about the latent difficulties due to some uncertainties in the new environment, I believe this encouragement brings far more advantages than disadvantages in the duration of development.



The movement of industries and businesses to the countryside will alleviate the burdens for cities to run smoothly. After the departure of those corporations, with the release of more spaces to develop housing and public facilities such as parks and sports fields, and with the reduction of population to consume the resources including education and health care, the original heavy burden of the city can be relieved to a large extent. Also, city order can be better maintained for the remaining citizens, due to the less severe competition for chances.



This movement can be beneficial to the development of the regional areas. To satisfy the demand of those businesses, and to run the companies successfully, the regional areas as well as the businesses will join effort in improving the construction of the basic facilities, which inevitably will promote the development there. In addition, in the duration of the running of businesses, exchange of resources both in production and consumption will be enhanced, and the chances for employment in those areas will be increased, leading to the growing vitality in economy.



Admittedly, just as any extremity may lead to adversity, moving all the industries and businesses out of the urban area into suburban ones may also generate new problems for both areas, such as the lack of driving force in the development in big cities and the too heavy burden on the resources in regional places. However, no government in the world is so stupid while carrying out their policies, which means, this will be implemented through scientific planning and meticulous consideration, leaving the above worries unnecessary.



To sum up, encouraging some companies to move to the regional areas will be beneficial to the development of both areas. With more activities like this going on, the country can be developed in a more balanced way.
