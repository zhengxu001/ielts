Books, radios and television are considered to be among the most popular media for communicating information. It is unquestionable that all of these media each has an irreplaceable place in human history, and they have their own advantages and disadvantages.

Books have been accompanying human beings for the longest time. Books nurture generation after generation by providing mental food accumulated for centuries. However, there are several weak points about books. For instance, it is not convenient for people on the go carrying piles of books. Besides, with the fast development of modern society, the update for books is far from meeting the social demands for the latest information.

Radios and television are products of industrialization and informatization. They have been playing a important role in people’s life for these recent dozens of years. They both can be used for spreading latest information even some instant messages. Radios are portable for individuals carrying around, while television is able to provide information satisfying people both ears and eyes. What is more, with the development of modern technique, an increasingly number of portable televisions have been invented and put into production. Nevertheless, because the information, which is conveyed via radios and television, draw more attention on currently evens, and often cannot analysis a topic deeply, people still need books to add essential supplement.

In conclusion, television has the advantages which radio and books are lack of when talking about efficiency. television is fresher compared with traditional books and it’s more vivid compared with radio.
