\# 经济全球化

Over the past few decades, more and more countries have opened up the markets, increasingly transforming the world economy into one free-flowing global market. The question is：Is economic globalization good for all?

Those who advocate globalization claim that economies in developing countries will benefit from .

According to the World Bank, one of its chief supporters, economic globalization has helped reduce poverty in a large number of developing countries.

Critics take a different view, believing that economic globalization is actually widen the gap between the rich and poor. A study carried out by the U.N.-sponsored World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalization shows that only a few developing countries have actually benefited from integration into the world economy and that the poor, the uneducated, unskilled workers, and native peoples have been left behind. Furthermore, they maintain that globalization may eventually threaten emerging businesses. For example, Indian craftsmen who currently seem to benefit from globalization because they are able to export their products may soon face fierce competition that could pot them out of business. When large-scale manufacturers start to produce the same goods, or when superstores like Wal-Mart move in, these small businesses will not be able to keep up and will be crowded out.

One thing is certain about globalization—there is no turning back. Advances in technology combined with more open policies have already created an interconnected world. The challenge now is finding a way to create a kind of globalization that works for the benefit of all.
