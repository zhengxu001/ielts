 Nobody is innate perpetrator，during the journey of life，those who are in the formative years are，sometimes，derailed by manifold causes such as the negative influence of negative mass media, the disadvantaged family background or external factors. In this sense, stricter penalty for the first offenders, unintentional lawbreakers is far from rational, especially when taking the teenagers’ immature mentality into account. Virtually, appropriate punishment is commendable, to motivate those juvenile offenders to serve the community or sweeping the street can be reasonable measures.

Not with standing all that, taking the effects of a misconsuct and its motivation into consideration is a prerequisite for ensuring justice of the law. There should not be fixed punishment for all youth crime. Some misdeeds, for example, school bullying or sex assaults will inevitably distress the sufferers and endanger the socity. Hence, light penalty for felony is unwise. Conversely, stricter punishment for hardened criminals will not only embody the justice of law but also exert a deterrent effect on those potential malefactors.

To sum up, there is no simple resolution for such a complicate social problem, it is reasonable to expect that the combination of these suggestions may be needed. Custom-tailored penalty may be the best strategy for each teenage crime.
