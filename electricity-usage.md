The curve chart above illustrates the typical daily demanding amount of electricity in England in summer and winter, while the pie chart reveals the specific various ways of using electricity in every family of Britain in average.

Firstly, for the graph, the demanding units of electricity in winter always almost double that in summer through all the daytime. During the first 9hours, the units of electricity in summer decline steadily, while the winter figure fluctuates from approximately 40000 to 30000. After that , bath figures rise almost with a same extent from 9.00 to about 15.00after which the data of summer just varies in a very small range. However, the units of electricity in winter continue increasing to a peak of approximately 45000 at 21 oâ€™clock after which there is a dramatic decrease.

In terms of the pie chart, more than half of the demanding for electricity is occupied by heating rooms and water, while the amount of electricity used in ovens, kettles or washing machines is just one third of the heating figure. However, lighting, TV, radio and vacuum cleaners, food mixers, electric tools both have the same data which is the smallest proportion in the pie chart.

Overall, typical daily demand for electricity varies from that in summer, while the percentages of different ways of using electricity are also various.

Overall, it is clear that demanding units of electricity is much higher in winter, and heating rooms and warming water are the major uses for electricity in the whole year.
