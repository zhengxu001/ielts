1. Do you often invite friends to visit your home?

  * Not very often, as I'm always busy with my work. But I'd like to invite my friends to my home at weekdens if I have enough time to prepare a small party. We can grab a few beers and play board games. That's what parties should be like, filed with laughs, filed with people talking. It's enjoyable.
