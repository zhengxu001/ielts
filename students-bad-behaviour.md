**In many countries schools have severe problems with student behavior. What do you think are the causes of this? What solutions can be suggested?**

Violence，violation of rules, skipping classes now are not uncommon in schools of many countries. A variety of factors attribute to bad behavior of students, but in my opinion, the root causes of these abnormal behaviors are the negative influence of media, parenting and schooling.

Nowadays, media, such as TV show and films, are saturated with violence and pornography, which can affect students negatively. Students, who are too young to distinguish between right and wrong, tend to imitate what they have seen on TV, resulting in bullying or violence in school. Moreover, in present-day society, as most parents of students lead stressful lives, parental neglect may cause serious problems of children’s mental health. Violating school rules purposefuly is becoming one way for youngsters to attract their parents’ attention.

More importantly, in terms of school rules, not all the schools today make the rules and carry out them stringently enough; therefore, many students are used to skipping classes for playing computer games or just having fun, etc. Not only can improper rules indulge youngsters, but can ruin the reputation of schooling as well.

Based on the above analysis, I am fully convinced that immediate measures should be taken to combat the situation. Priority should be given to restricting violence and pornographic contents on TV or avoiding youngster from being exposed to them, thereby preventing students from imitating them. Also, despite that parents are busy, they should spend more time on their offsprings and give them more concern and love, then youngsters would be more considerate of others and more sociable and responsible. Finally, to schools, it is imperative that they should shoulder their responsibilities to instruct youngsters to establish a positive outlook on life and keep them from going astray.

Overall, the reasons of students’ bad behaviors are complicated; consequently, we should take a wide range of measures, especially enhancing schooling quality, to address these problems before the damage caused by this trend becomes irreversible.
