&gt;&gt; Many people use distance-learning programmes \(study material post, TV, Internet, etc.\) to study at home, but some people think that it cannot bring the benefit as much as attending college or university. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?



Distance learning is a relatively recent phenomenon and consequently it is somewhat controversial. With good reason, many people question whether technology can really change how we can learn. Others, however, make a convincing argument that classroom-based learning has its limitations. Considering both sides, it is clear that there is value in both approaches.



Let us first consider the pros of traditional, classroom-based learning. From the time of the ancient Greeks and Chinese and perhaps before, we have clung to the idea of a “teacher;” one who shares his \/ her wisdom and expertise. This model has been tested and survived the ages. Teachers not only can share knowledge, but they can assess, correct and motivate students. Truly there is great value in this.



That said, remote learning also has its own upside. Consider, for example, students who live in remote areas without roads or funds to pay for tuition to attend a school far away . . . an Internet connection solves this. Also, there is something to be said for students being more independent learners, and online learning develops this skill.



So the question really is not “Which one?” but rather, “How we can combine both?” It seems perfectly reasonable that students attend some classes in person, but also use the web to communicate with other students and professors as well as research various topics. Countries and societies need to assess which approach and balance works best for them.



So while we should harness the potential of new technology that makes remote learning possible, we should not neglect the importance of traditional learning. Student without teachers will surely be lost; but students who simply rely on teachers for knowledge aren’t really learning.
