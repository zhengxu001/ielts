The table shows the proportion of people from each household type living in poverty in Australia in the year of 1999.

the percentage of all households living in poverty was as high as 11% in 1999, involving 1,837,000 people, of which sole parent families and single-without- children families accounted for 21% and 19% respectively.

Couples generally tended to be better off, with lower **poverty** levels for couples without children\(7%\) than those with children\(12%\). It is **noticeable** that for both types of householdwith children, a higher than average **proportion** were living in **poverty** at this time.

Older people were generally less likely to be poor, though once again the **trend** favored eldercouples\(only 4%\) rather than single elderly people\(6%\).

Overall the table suggests that households of single adults and those with children were more likely to be living in **poverty** than those consisting of couples.
