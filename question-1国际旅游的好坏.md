&gt;&gt;&gt; International tourism has become a huge industry in the world. Do the problems of international travel outweigh its advantages?



With the general decrease in travelling costs, international travel is becoming more prevalent. For a variety of reasons and with great frequency, people are travelling to other countries. International visitors bring their own range of behaviours and customs to the countries they visit. I believe the advantages international travelers bring to the countries they choose to visit outweigh the negatives. 

Unfortunately, all countries have within them people who exhibit undesirable behaviour. The vociferous minority seem to leave an impression in the minds of people in host counties. Whether it be leaving the hotel room in a complete mess, or loudly arguing about matter with a local person, international visitors are sometimes a poor advertisement for their counties. This is certainly the negative side of international visitors. 

However, the far greater impression international visitors leave is a good one. Typically, international visitors bring with them money which they inject into the local economy they are visiting which is excellent for business. They can also educate the local people about what life is like in other part of the world. These international travellers are like “ambassadors” for their county and can cause others to want to visit their country—this brings with its obvious economic benefits as well. In addition, international visitors can help others to see things from a different perspective and, often, improve on the way things are down. 

Problems can arise from international visitors however, the benefits they bring to the countries thy visit are greater. International visitors around the world will continue to impact the countries to which they travel, it is up to the individual to make sure the example they set is a good one.
