Dear Mr. Smith,

I am writing to ask for some time off work next month.

The reason for this \_\_\_request\_\_\_ is that my brother is getting married. His future wife is Australian, and the wedding will take \_\_\_place\_\_\_ in her home city, Melbourne. As the brother of the groom, I cannot miss such a special occasion.

To attend the ceremony and make the round trip from the UK, I would need at least five days off work. However, I would like to take the opportunity to do some sightseeing in Australia, and so I am hoping that you will allow me to take a full two weeksâ€™ leave, from the 1st to the 15th of May.

I have spoken to my co-workers, and it seems that Peter Jones would be best placed to cover my project commitments while I am away. I will \_\_\_\_\_\_ detailed instructions for him on my desk.

I hope that my request does not cause you any inconvenience.

Yours sincerely,

Michael Hall
