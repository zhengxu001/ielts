## 全球化的利弊

&gt;&gt; Some people think the increasing business and cultural contact between countries brings many positive effects. Others say it causes the loss of national identities. Discuss on both sides and give your opinion.

Over the past few decades, more and more countries have opened up the markets, increasingly transforming the world economy into one free-flowing global market. All countries are cooperating more closely together in a wide range of fields, such as business and cultural exchange. But many people concern that is economic globalization good for all? I think that the advantages of globalisation outweigh disadvantages.

Globalisation has many benifits for countries. Due to the economically motivated, both states and entrepreneurs are interested not only in the domestic market but also in the oversea market. The closer connection opens up huge potential opportunities for business corporation. Economies in developing countries will also benefit from globalization, because international trade provides these countries with opportunities to export goods and services to high-income countries and earn foreign exchange. Besides, the more cultural contacts, the better understanding of other peoples. Cultural communication can alter people's attitude towards another culture and embrace different values, which will promote multi-cultural understanding and even remove cultural barriers.

Admittedly, the cross-national interaction will also impose a negative influence on national identities, especially to those weak countries. Many people in these countries tend to adopt western habits because advertisements and movies from western countries have conquered the screen and they regard these habits as fashionable, which reflects the foreign cultural invasion to some degree. For instance, the mainstream value of teenagers in these countries has been mainly shaped by Hollywood blockbusters instead of their traditional literature or other artistic works. They choose to eat fast food and celebrate western festivals such as Christmas, and this means that some of their own traditions and norms may disappear.

In my opinion, globalization can help develop the economic and we can also have a better understanding of other contries' culture. But we also may encourage people to preserve their cultures. I believe the globalization is good for the contries' development
