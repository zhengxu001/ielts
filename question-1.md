## 全球化的利弊

&gt;&gt; Some people think the increasing business and cultural contact between countries brings many positive effects. Others say it causes the loss of national identities. Discuss on both sides and give your opinion.

Over the past few decades, more and more countries have opened up the markets, increasingly transforming the world economy into one free-flowing global market. All countries are cooperating more closely together in a wide range of fields, such as business and cultural exchange. But many people concern that is economic globalization good for all? I think that the advantages of globalisation outweigh disadvantages.

Globalisation has many benifits for countries. Due to the economically motivated, both states and entrepreneurs are interested not only in the domestic market but also in the oversea market. The closer connection opens up huge potential opportunities for business corporation.

Economies in developing countries will benefit from globalization, because some underdeveloped countries lack capital, technology and infrastructure. International trade provides these countries with opportunities to export goods and services to high-income countries and earn foreign exchange, which can drive economic growth and improve citizens’ living standards.

On the other hand, critics take a different view. Many people tend to adopt western habits because advertisements and movies from western countries have conquered the screen and they regard these habits as fashionable. They choose to eat fast food and celebrate western festivals such as Christmas, and this means that some of their own traditions and norms may disappear.

In my opinion, globalisation may encourage people to preserve their cultures. The expansion of some industries including tourism has made it possible for these people to realise the distinctive characteristics of their cultures. The growing popularity of their cultures, heritage sites and works of art can instill a sense of pride in these communities and this is why residents can make a conscious effort to protect their cultures.

In conclusion, as countries are interconnected, some disadvantaged areas can expect economic growth and people who live in these areas will also pay attention to their heritage.
