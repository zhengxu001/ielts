&gt;&gt;&gt; Unlike in most other countries, police in the UK do not commonly carry guns. Some people think it leaves citizens unprotected. But others think it reduces the overall violence in our society. Discuss both sides of the view and give your opinion.


At the mention of a policeman， most people will have in their mind the image of a strong man or woman with a gun on his belt. But it is not the case in UK： police there do not carry guns. People’s opinions towards this vary.

Some people think this contributes to the decrease of violence in society. For one thing， when a robber sees a policeman pointing a gun at him， he may get exasperated and desperate and， out of despair， he may hurt people around him. If the policeman does not carry a gun，nothing of the kind will happen. For another，to err is human and no one can guarantee that a policeman does not miss-shoot the pedestrians when he is hurriedly chasing a criminal. Lastly，some policemen have committed serious crimes with the guns they had.

However， other people hold different views： police without guns leave citizens unprotected. To begin with， at critical moments， guns in policemen’s hands can be essential in fighting against the criminals. Imagine a bank robber pointing a gun at the head of a hostage. A policeman can hardly do anything about it if he does not carry a gun. However，the situation can be totally reversed otherwise. Moreover，policemen are well-trained and thus rarely hurt innocent people with their guns.

As far as I am concerned， the latter is more favorable. To my mind， policemen are the very few people on earth who should carry guns， with which they can effectively protect the citizens. （271words）

Police, as protectors of his people, should do what they can, and use whatever means they can, to keep people out of harm‘s way. But in the UK, police are on duty without carrying a gun, which is a very bad idea. They are handicapping themselves.

Generally speaking, gun is recognized as an emblem of power and justice of police. It is clear that a police with gun on is able to prevent those potential criminal activities. For instance, a pistol on the belt works effectively to stop crimes ranging from those robberies, theft, and rape and it can also force the criminals to be arrested.

Furthermore, gun serves for a reliable friend while the police crash into an emergent situation like gun fighting or commotion. Guns are not expected to be employed to finish off the chaos but to help the police survive before the reinforcement comes.

Meanwhile, the violence rate is rising in UK due to the global terrorism. Unlike the ordinary gangster and robbers who is armed daggers and knives, a large number of international terrorists are equipped with semi-auto rifles and massive destruction weapons. Proper measures must be taken to limit the uneven contrast of power and the great efforts should be made to protect civilian from the harm of terrorist attack. However, there is an old saying “combat poison with poison”, say, an overall upgrading of UK police equipments couldn’t be better to meet the needs. It is all necessary that every police carries a pistol while they are on duty, which would be the practicable way to ensure the public security in Briton.

As a consequence, having carry guns by police will evidently benefit people in UK, and of which will lead to a more steady and harmonic society. If there must be a controversy, it would go to whether the government should place a curb upon the possible abuse of gun. （318words）

Unlike most countries, the police in the United Kingdom do not normally carry guns. Some people think it leaves citizens unprotected, while others believe that this practice reduces the overall violence in society. Police having guns however is an issue secondary to criminals having guns. \(45words\)

Because criminals usually have access to guns, police officers need them in order to control crime. If police in the U.K. are able to go without guns and not have crime getting completely out of control then they have already set a fine example that other countries should follow. The fact that they are able to do this is an indication of their ability to control the flow of guns to the general populace and this makes citizens safer than anything else. To a civilian, taking guns away from criminals is more important than giving them to police. \(98words\)

For places that are not able to, or are unwilling to control this availability of guns to criminals, police have no choice. Countries with weak or ineffective gun laws, or countries bordering such countries, like Mexico which has strong gun laws, but virtually no way to prevent them from being smuggled over the border from the U.S., need a police force that is not only armed, but is armed better than the criminals. This ‘domestic arms race’ is the fate of any country that does not realize that civilians have no need of being armed and should have no access to weapons whatsoever.\(103words\)

The root of the problem is embarrassingly corrupt governments and ineffective half-measures taken to control the circulation of guns, which allows criminals to easily come into possession of guns. Nations around the world should hope to someday reach the point where their police force can afford not to carry guns and still be effective. \(54words\)
