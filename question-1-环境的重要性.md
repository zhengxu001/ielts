&gt;&gt;&gt; （食品安全）Some people support the developments in agriculture such as factory farming andcreations of new types of fruits and vegetables, while others oppose this view. Discuss both views and give your opinion. 

Some people think that the developments in agriculture, such as factory farming and creation of new types of vegetables, have brought us more benefits than problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

In modern-day society, the problems of health are increasingly serious. In the meantime, the issue of whether the developments in agriculture will bring us more benefits than troubles is becoming highly debatable. In this essay, I will discuss this issue.

Some people tend to think that promoting the development of agriculture is beneficial to human race. First of all, if we take properly measures to promote the development of farming and invest a number of money in it, which can generate more employment opportunities. Moreover, technology must be play a significant role in agriculture in terms of factory farming because machines and computers are time-consuming and economical, which make more people to have spare time to do other work. In addition, individuals may be healthier due to creation of new types of vegetables. Therefore, in order to improve us body, we need the developments in agriculture.

On the other side of debate, many argue that the developments also bring some problems. The main reason of their view is reasonable primary because the creation of new types of vegetables may brings new insects and even cause other plants to go extinct. Furthermore, the nature has its own balance and rules, but if we occupied much place for farming, then with reducing number of trees, the air pollution will be spun out of control. However, that is not convincing enough for the issues of developments in agriculture because these problems will be solved by the development of science.

In summary, I will agree with the view that the developments of farming will help us more efficiently and effectively rather than imposing a heavy burden on human race. I also warn the people who want to break the ecosystem balance indeed.
