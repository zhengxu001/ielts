&gt;&gt;&gt; In many parts of the world children and teenagers are committing more crimes. Why is this case happening? How should children or teenagers be punished?



Over the last few decades, many cities around the world have seen alarming increases in the levels of youth crime. This essay will discuss the reasons for this problem and provide some possible solutions.





The first reason is connected with the family. In order for a child to grow up in a balanced way, it is very important that he or she is nurtured well by his or her parents. However, these days, it is often the case that children are neglected. This may be because of the fact that many parents in cities now both have to work so are often not around to give their children support when needed. Another factor is the increasing levels of poverty around the world. We have seen with globalization the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, and this inevitably means that those who are poorer will have to resort to illegal means to get what others have. Many studies on juvenile delinquency reported the close link between teenage crimes and economic problems in families. Youth belonging from poor economical status easily get involved in criminal activities, as they want to improve their status and for this purpose they use negative path.



The measures of punishment for juvenile offenders vary in different countries. In some places, teenage law-breakers are punished in the same way as the adult criminals, as people think everyone should be treated equally once they break the law and cause severe consequences. Others, however, hold that rehabilitation is a more effective way to deal with young offenders. They believe young people, unlike adults, are with weaker powers of reasoning and less control of their impulses, therefore juvenile offenders could not be held responsible for crimes in the same way adults are. They argue foralternatives to detentionlike restorative justice and advocate community-based programs for low-level and first-time offenders.



To conclude, the risk factors for juvenile delinquency might be multiple, and measures of penalty are supposed to be taken as long as the purpose is to help the youth stay away from crimes.
