IELTS General Writing: the opening sentence

After writing "Dear..." it's a good idea to establish the main purpose of the letter straight away in your opening sentence. Here are some examples:

* Formal letter \(e.g. complaining to a manager\)
  * I am writing to complain about the unacceptable state of the room I was given, and the unhelpful attitude of certain members of staff at your hotel.


* Semi-formal letter \(e.g. inviting a neighbour\)
  * My wife and I would like to invite you to a dinner party at our home next Saturday evening.


* Informal letter \(e.g. thanking a friend\)
  * I hope you're well. I'm just writing to say thanks for letting me stay over at your house while I was in London last week.
