The chart gives information about post-school qualifications in terms of the different levels of further education reached by men and women in Australia in 1999.

We can see immediately that there were substantial differences in the proportion of men and women at different levels. The biggest gender difference is at the lowest post-school level, where 90% of those who held a skilled vocational diploma were men, compared with only 10% of women. By contrast, more women held undergradute diplomas\(70%\) and marginally more women reached Bachelor's degree level\(55%\).

At the higher levels of education, men with postgraduate diplomas clearly outnumbered their female counterparts\(70% and 30%, respectively\), and also consituted 60% of Master's graduates.

Thus we can see that more men than women hold qulifications at the lower and higher levels of education, while more women reach undergraduate diploma level than men. The gender difference is smallest at the level of Bachelor's degree, however.
